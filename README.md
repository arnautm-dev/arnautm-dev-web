# arnautm-dev website

This is my portfolio web. I have created it with an AI generated website target. [Look the model here](https://appgen.com/share/47afcf84-c025-44e1-8643-a7ee9034b822). i didn't copy it because it isn't in HTML.

## Languages
I have used HTML5 and CSS3. There is only a little JavaScript part for injecting the header and the footer.

## Structure
This is the web structure
```

├── index.html
├── styles.css

    ├── articles
    └── articles-assets
            └── articles extra-content
```
## Design
The colours I have used are these ones:
-    White background: ```#ffffff```
-    Darker background: ```#f7fafc```
-    Title colour: ```#0f172a```
-    Simple text colour: ```#525569```
-    Strong text colour: ```#4f46e5```
-    Strong background: ```#f1f5f9```

In the other hand, the font of that web it's [Mulish](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Mulish), connected from Google Fonts. The icons are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons), recommended to me by ChatGPT: I liked it.
